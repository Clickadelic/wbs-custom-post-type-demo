# wbs-custom-post-type-demo
A WordPress plugin to demonstrate the use case for Custom Post Types in WordPress.

# How can I use this plugin
You should download it (Clone or old school download) and put it in wp-content/plugins/wbs-custom-post-type-demo
Then activate it.

# Don't forget to flush your rewrite rules
After the installation and activation, you need to go to settings > permalinks in order to update the .htaccess file.
WordPress calls this "flush rewrite rules". Just visit this site, that's it. WP will do it in the background.
